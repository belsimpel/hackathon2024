## Installation guide
This section contains all relevant information to setup the necessary things to participate in the hackathon. You will be setting up a Docker environment running two services: MySQL and PHPMyAdmin. We've created a docker-compose.yml file, which should do most of the work for you.

### Clone Github repository
Start by cloning the Github repository on your device. Most of you will probably have done this before, but if not we highly recommend the following **before** cloning the repository.
1. Create a Github account --> [Sign up here!](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)
2. Add SSH token to your account --> [How do I do that??](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
3. Install Git on your device --> [More instructions!](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

Now you should be ready to clone the repository:
1. Navigate to a folder on your device where you would like to clone the repository into.
2. Clone the repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:belsimpel/hackathon2024.git
```
3. Navigate into the repository.
```
cd hackathone2024
```
4. Ready!
